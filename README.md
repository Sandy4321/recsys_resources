### Well-documented rec-sys projects on Kaggle *
MovieLens dataset, good walkthrough, covers content-based, collaborative, and hybrid of the two systems *

Another well-written kernel, compares different algorithms and approaches to recommendation systems (more technical than the one above), including deep learning with Keras *

### Datasets

List of the 7 main recommender datasets on Kaggle (as of late-2018), except for movie datasets which seem to be the most popular

(no projects/tutorials available on data.world; duplicates may exist on Kaggle):

##### Restaurant & consumer data
The dataset was obtained from a recommender system prototype. The task was to generate a top-n list of restaurants according to the consumer preferences.
